# Docker Deployment Platform with Django

This project is a Docker deployment platform built using Django, designed to simplify the deployment of Docker containers with customizable ports. It provides a web interface for users to input Docker image URLs and port configurations, which are then deployed as Docker containers on the host system.

## Features

- **Deployment Interface**: User-friendly web interface to input Docker image URLs and port configurations.
- **Docker Integration**: Uses Docker Engine API to pull images and create containers based on user inputs.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors gracefully during image pull or container creation.
- **Logging**: Logs deployment activities and errors for troubleshooting.
- **ngrok Integration**: Utilizes ngrok to create secure tunnels from localhost to the public internet, enabling temporary access to local Docker deployments.
- **Port 3000**: Frontend development server runs on port 3000 for React.js.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: React.js (for the deployment form, running on port 3000)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (as configured in `docker-compose.yml`)
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application itself and for deploying user-provided containers
- **ngrok**: Secure tunneling for exposing local services to the internet

## Getting Started

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.7 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker-deployment-platform.git
   cd docker-deployment-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. Access the application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
2. Enter the Docker image URL and port configurations in the form.
3. Click on "Deploy" to initiate the deployment process.
4. View deployment logs and status messages.

### Example Deployment

- **Docker Image URL**: `nginx:latest`
- **Port Configuration**: `80`

### ngrok Setup

To expose your local Docker deployments temporarily to the public internet using ngrok, follow these steps:

1. Download and install ngrok from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/)
2. Run ngrok to create a tunnel to port 8000:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
3. Use the generated ngrok URL to access your local Docker deployments remotely.

### API Endpoints

- **POST `/api/deploy/`**: Initiates deployment of a Docker container based on user input.
